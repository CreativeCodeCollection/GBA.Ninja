This is an emscripten port of https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m. The following features
are supported:
 * Video Output (via a WebGL textured quad)
 * Audio Output (via HTML5 audio API)
 * Savegames (via localStorage)
 * Keyboard Input

This is not a GitHub fork because I have no intention of PRing it.

## TODOs
 * Improve audio sync
 * Fix input on IE
 * Keep aspect ratio
 * Touch controls
 * Publish
 * Loading screen
 * Enable frameskip on slow devices
 * More options for loading roms
 * Key bindings menu
 * Browser compatibility display
 * List, Export & Delete savegames
 * Cache roms in HTML5 FS
 * Rom streaming
 * Investigate busy loop elimination
